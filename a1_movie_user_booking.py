Assessment 1: A user login function for the online movie ticket booth

Description: Combine m61 and m62 to create an advanced online ticketing system
that can allow members to login. Since we need to check their age for the movie,
make sure age is also part of the user dictionary! Users should only be allowed 
to buy a movie ticket after they have signed up for an account.
Hint: You can create a switch that is "off" and is turned on when a users successfully
signs in. And the movie showings segment should only run IF the switch is "on".
